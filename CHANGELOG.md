# Changelog

All notable changes to this platform are tracked here by milestone.

## [Milestone 1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- Repository scaffold: full top-level directory structure (`agents/`, `workflows/`, `templates/`, `standards/`, `knowledge/`, `scripts/`, `playbooks/`, `policies/`, `checklists/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `automation/`, `diagrams/`, `training/`).
- `README.md` — platform overview, design principles, structure.
- `CLAUDE.md` — operating instructions for AI assistants working in this repository.
- `LICENSE` (MIT).
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution rules and review checklist.
- First specialist agent: `agents/chief-infrastructure-engineer/AGENT.md` — the orchestrating agent that routes work to other specialists and owns overall engagement quality.

### Next milestone
- Agent and workflow templates (`agents/_TEMPLATE.md`, `workflows/_TEMPLATE.md`) to formalize the structure referenced in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Second specialist agent: VMware Architect (given active production relevance).
- First reusable workflow: AD Domain Controller upgrade (given active production relevance).

## [Milestone 2] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- `agents/_TEMPLATE.md` — formal agent definition template (Mission, Scope, Responsibilities, Decision Framework, Vendor Guidance, Escalation Rules, Deliverables, Output Format, Quality Checklist).
- `workflows/_TEMPLATE.md` — formal workflow definition template (Executive Summary, Prerequisites, Assessment, Risk Analysis, Dependencies, Implementation, Validation, Rollback, Acceptance Criteria, Lessons Learned).
- Second specialist agent: `agents/vmware-architect/AGENT.md` — owns ESXi/vCenter/storage/networking/VM lifecycle, PowerCLI automation, and vSphere-layer compliance.
- First reusable workflow: `workflows/active-directory-domain-controller-lifecycle/WORKFLOW.md` — expanded from "upgrade only" to a full DC lifecycle covering seven scenarios: New DC Build/Promotion, In-Place OS Upgrade, DC Replacement (Swing Migration), FSMO Role Transfer/Seizure, Replication Troubleshooting, Decommission/Demotion, and Disaster Recovery (DC restore, authoritative restore, forest recovery).

### Next milestone
- `templates/change-request.md` and `templates/rca.md`, referenced by both agents built so far but not yet created.
- Third specialist agent: Windows Infrastructure Engineer or Backup & DR Architect (both are named as owning agents in the AD DC workflow but don't exist yet as formal agent files).
- `standards/powershell.md`, referenced by the VMware Architect agent but not yet created.
